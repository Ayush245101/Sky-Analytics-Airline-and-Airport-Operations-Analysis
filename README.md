# Sky Analytics: Airline and Airport Operations Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes flight, airline, and airport data to uncover key insights on operational efficiency, delays, cancellations, and airport connectivity within the aviation industry.

## Data Sources
- **flights.csv:** Detailed flight info (schedules, delays, distances, delay reasons, cancellations).
- **airlines.csv:** Airline codes and names.
- **airports.csv:** Airport codes, names, locations, and coordinates.

## Highlights

- **Data Quality:** Most missing data is random; only a few missing locations in airports data.
- **Average Delays:** Frontier, American Eagle, and JetBlue have the highest average delays.
- **Busiest Airports:** Atlanta (ATL) is the busiest and most connected; Chicago Oâ€™Hare (ORD) has the highest delays.
- **Cancellations:** Envoy Air (MQ) has the highest cancellation rate; weather is the leading cause.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Slightly more delays and cancellations in winter months.
- **Delays vs. Distance:** Weak correlation; delays are mostly due to operations or weather, not flight length.
- **On-Time Performance:** Delta is the most punctual; Frontier is the least.
- **Delay Causes:** Late aircraft and airline operations are the top reasons for delays.
- **Fleet Utilization:** Southwest Airlines operates the most flights per aircraft.
- **Geographical Trends:** Texas, California, and Alaska have the most airports; Midwest/Northeast airports face more winter delays.
- **Efficiency:** Most airlines operate close to optimal efficiency, but some show significant deviations.

## Usage
1. Place the CSV files in the project directory.
2. Run the provided analysis scripts or open the dashboard for interactive exploration.

## Recommendations
- Focus on reducing operational delays and late aircraft turnarounds.
- Invest in weather resilience for northern airports.
- Use efficiency and delay impact metrics to benchmark performance.
